        <p>Maroon 5 is an American pop rock band <br> from Los Angeles, California. <br>
            It currently consists of,<br>
            <strong>1.Adam Levine </strong> ~ <em>lead vocalist </em> <br> 
            <strong>2.Jesse Carmichael </strong>~ <em>keyboardist and rhythm guitarist </em> <br>
             <strong>3.James Valentine </strong>~ <em>lead guitarist</em> <br>
            <strong>4.PJ Morton ~ </strong> <em>keyboardist</em> and,<br>
            <strong>5.Sam Farrar</strong> ~ <em>multi-instrumentalist.</p></em>

            <p>The bond between the members of <br> the band is believed to be weakening, <br> this is because in the recent years, <br>
                 members of the band have been releasing <br> solo songs and not in band. <br>
               Through this solo songs, <br> I felt in love with Alan's. Following up on him, <br> I found their band's songs 
               and <br> from there, it has been my favorite band. </p>
